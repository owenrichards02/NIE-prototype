But my they already had my sister's name picked out. When it came to me they were really unprepared.

</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">6:56</p>
<p class="speech">fantastic. So what we're going to do, we're quite limited for space, but we can do a few kind of like practical things. If at any point you've been uncomfortable, or you don't want to ask the questions. You have absolute freedom to do that. So don't feel that you have to answer anything to do anything. It's totally your choice this afternoon. Okay. And if you've been uncomfortable at any stage, obviously speak to Sarah or Carrie, and then they can take you out of space but I don't think you'll be fine. So it's just to kind of give you that that sort of heads up. So what do you do? It's a quick name of prequels kind of get into the concept of this game carrier, you're most welcome to join in timeout. So what I might do is just move this chair over there. That's okay. We don't need this one and quite simply, we played this before because at school maybe. Great so you're on apple, banana, orange, apple, banana, orange, apple, banana, orange, okay. Quite simply, if I call out your fruit, you're going to move to a different chair and we want to have missing so be kind to each other. A little bit scrambling for the chair as it were in my shout out fruitful you're all going to move. Does that make sense? Guys? Okay, so fruit Oh, you just eliminated. Oh, that's okay. Apples Okay, so sorry, Yusef might actually give you the instruction. You're allowed to get back into the space at that point. So can we sit back down again we use f6. But so when the on the next meeting as well. All right. Does that make sense? So even if there's one chair missing, whoever stood up they can move as well. Fruit Oh, there we go. Good, good. Good. Orange oranges go free Paul.</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Unknown Speaker</b></p><p class="timestamp">9:20</p>

<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">9:33</p>
<p class="speech">difference. So what is gonna pay again, the sun shines. And what we're gonna do is I'm going to start and then I'm going to pass over to one of you. And it's quite simple. I'm going to say the sun shines on anyone who likes to do tick tock. Okay, if you're one of those tech to hop dancing people, you're going to move on to another space in the circle. I'm going to call out lots of different things and I don't know anything about you. So there might be slight slight generalisations. I'm just going to throw them out there. And what I would like you to do is kind of watch the circle. And I want you to kind of notice where people really move. And when people don't move that much. Does that make sense? So what we're trying to look for is connections, similarities between us, and we're going to do that by watching each other in the space sometimes I do this and then one moves and that's always quite interesting. It's different with every single group that I work with because we will have different interests. Okay. So I'm gonna say the sun shines and anyone that likes to have chicken McDonald's once a week. You are a healthy group. I love that that's making the other day those of you this is what I mean. The sun shines on anyone who loves doing tick tock dances. It's okay, we can do</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">11:07</p>

<p class="speech">Yeah. Wonderful. Yeah. It takes you to a different place. That could be really nice to do that. And I think you know, watching films go to you know, anything like that. It's really a great form of escapism, which can be really, really positive for your health. The sun shines on anyone who likes to hang out in the park. Nobody in the space. That's really really good.</p>

</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">19:45</p>
<p class="speech">going on so when you first get into town, you go shopping, is it usually Primark is your first destination where do you go? Okay, okay. Is it is busy in Arizona? Yeah, it's a bit hectic, isn't it? Do you Yeah, no, you're saying actually so good. So shopping there. Who goes into town during the day? Sometimes I'm going to be goes into into town during the day boots. It goes into town during the day. town after hours when it gets to you. Okay, so that's always quite interesting. Not worried about going to turn offs or hours doesn't bother you know, who doesn't someone make a decision over here. You don't go into after hours ones.</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Unknown Speaker</b></p><p class="timestamp">20:52</p>
<p class="speech">I think my mom would just get called</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">20:58</p>
<p class="speech">very frank. sensible. So that's quite an interesting one that's been coming up and you're happy just to go Neva, Utah doesn't bother you too much. Yeah. Okay. So I think what we're going to do now is get to know you a little bit more and we're going to do some really cool artwork and I've got lots of stickers tonight stickers. Okay, hopefully you all Why don't you just get to know about us a little bit more in your different worlds. Because we all have different worlds that we live in. And I always say that we have ourselves also true selves. If that makes sense. Sometimes we're at home, and it's just you. But then we have different parts of ourselves, don't we when we go into different places, different environments, different situations. It would be really fun just to learn a bit more about you and your different worlds when you look at for all those different worlds now so if you could just go to a table and I will explain. I would like you just to grab a torch as well. When you hit your table or something. You're gonna get the cool new V ones and you're gonna get to find your own table. You've got a table this is a cool you reload</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">22:11</p>
<p class="speech">Okay, so you get a table Ah, you also get your own tables. So, if you get money that should be enough tables to go around because you get a piece of paper each to get thrown out.</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Unknown Speaker</b></p><p class="timestamp">22:30</p>
<p class="speech">Okay, so what we're gonna do</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Unknown Speaker</b></p><p class="timestamp">22:37</p>
<p class="speech">because I thought it was okay</p>
</li>
<li class="dialogue">
<p class="speaker"><b>Speaker 1</b></p><p class="timestamp">22:48</p>
<p class="speech">so, I'm just gonna show you just to begin with. Okay, so actually, I probably should have done this. Do this in the board. Okay, Can y'all see here? You will see here. Yeah. Okay, so we're gonna think about different worlds that you live in, and how they support you. Kind of make you feel Do you feel connected disconnected? hobbies, interests, the whole shebang. So if you take your torches on your piece of paper, and it'll do very, very, very, very, very first circle, you're going to create like a little circle. Okay. And in that first little circle, if you just put it into the centre, if they're not working, we'll get your loved ones in the battery. So I've gone down a bit. Okay. So that first circle is going to be your circle. And the minute we're going to title that I'll put the lights on while we're doing the art and then we'll turn the lights on, because everything blows up and it's really cool. So we'll do that at the end. This first circle is you. Okay, so this is you at home. This is at you when you're in your home environment, maybe your bedroom, your immediate space, and within that circle in a minute, we're going to draw that first circle. And what we're going to do is you're going to write in that circle, everything that defines that space for you, and how it makes you feel and using all the stickers if you just use your torches over to the sticker piles, there's loads and loads of infographics here that you can choose from. What we might do is you might have a little walk around other people's circles because you might find other stickers and other people's tables that are more relative to you and you're gonna just basically decorate that first circle, you're going to call it me it's quite straightforward. You're going to write in their hobbies, interests, things that you like to do things that make you happy because that makes sense. Family Friends, pets, guardians, the whole shebang that makes you you Yes. Yeah. So if you can see your little sec, okay, I'm gonna probably go about that big. So we'll just draw it in a second. Okay, guys, and you just kind of decorate that. Then after that, we're going to take out we're gonna go to the next circle. So if you just make that slightly bigger with torches, and we're going to draw that around the first circle, and the next step was going to be called social network. So that's who and where you go to hang out with people. Does that make sense? That could be parks, that could be clubs. It could be part of pier. It could be you know, anywhere that you like to go hang out. It could be the shops. It could be the local fish and chips. So I don't know. Obviously, it's all relative to you. So that's first circle, second circle social network, take your torches, then we're gonna go a little bit bigger. And then that that third circle, it's gonna be education. Okay, so that could be school, college, maybe do online learning home learning. And you're going to talk again about what how that space to find you. Does that make sense? And you just going to use stickers, and you're going to draw, you can use words words are really good, just simple words that really define that space for you. I would like you to think about your emotions and all of these circles. Do they make you feel safe? Does it make you feel unsafe? Does that make you feel happy? Maybe they'll make you feel worried. You know, let's be really, really honest about it. And then you get your torches. There's a very, very last circle, which is really, really big is going to be the wider community and then the wider community we're going to think about the neighbourhood that you live in the wider community could be town, it could be your neighbourhood and how you fit within that and how that makes you felt. Does that make sense guys? So because we're doing the artwork again, we're ever gonna put the lights back on. Okay, so Joy Okay, so I have FYI, is a bit easier to use slightly darker colours when you're doing the circle. These Neons are great, but they're a little bit neon and you know what I mean? They're quite quite good for like drawings and doodles and things like that. So maybe you wanted to use a darker colour from here, just to do that off of the writing. So maybe you could use the neons to do the actual circles and maybe more than kind of specific detail who's like a sort of slightly darker font because otherwise it gets a bit wishy washy. All right, let's draw actually before we draw let's go around to everyone stick a table layout your stickers. I don't want you to go around and you might want to meet someone else's sticker. Because I don't know what stickers represent you. So you may sorry, Sarah may go on to another space. And find another sticker on your table. Okay, so let's just a minute go around the space and do the little sticker collection. Because you might find this other symbols and tables that are much more relevant to you</p>
